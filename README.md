# SimilarityNetworkFusion - RStudio

SNF is an R-Package that is used to fuse multiple networks to a final network. SNF verifies multiple views of a network before fusing.

This tool is developed to implement SNF. The example input files are with three different omic features (DNA methylation, mRNA, and miRNA) of same subjects. The final fused network is between subjects/observations, which is constructed using multi-omics.
